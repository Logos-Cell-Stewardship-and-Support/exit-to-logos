### Overview

*Mandate: The Mimulus Experiment*, also referred to as *The Monkey Flower Experiment*, is a participatory fiction project being authored by Ben West, set approximately five years into the future. The story unfolds on an experimental off grid mountain university campus that becomes isolated from the outside world following an extreme weather event, leaves students, staff, and local residents to self-organize and survive over the course of a year. This contained social experiment explores the intersections of decentralized governance, technological infrastructure, and cultural friction. It has been described as a cypherpunk (or solarpunk) "Lord of the Flies".

This project has been evolving for decades at this point since Ben wes a student at a university in North Vancouver that was on the side of a moutain on the west coast of Canada. 

The work has evolved into a multimedia speculative fiction narrative now being developed as a full-length interactive novel and open-source community storytelling platform with illustrations and animation.

### Narrative Structure

The book is written entirely through:
- Blog posts and journal entries
- Decentralized social media threads
- Meeting transcripts and governance wikis
- Surveillance footage summaries and system logs
- In-universe AI-generated summaries, simulations, and forecasts

This structure simulates the fragmented, polyvocal experience of life inside an emergent parallel society, and mirrors real-world decentralized networks of information and decision-making. It has been described as a cypherpunk (or solarpunk) Lord of the Flies.

### Themes

- The tension between centralized control and decentralized resilience
- Cultural, economic, and power asymmetries in post-crisis governance
- The role of local compute, mesh networks, and cryptographic identity
- Governance experiments, failure modes, and institutional memory
- Parallel societies as necessity, not utopia

### Spoiler Alert: 

The students and faculty overthrow the university administration and set up their own governance but face challenges from the home owners that live near the campus as well as the Indigenous community that lives further up the moutain and were the first inhabitants. The story navigates these problems and others in an environment that is completely cut off from the outside world.

### Tech Stack (Refactored to Dogfood Logos)

Originally envisioned as a localized mesh of Raspberry Pi nodes running a custom blockchain and forum software (Hard Hat and Scuttlebutt), the new version of the Mimulus infrastructure stack has been re-architected to fully **dogfood the Logos toolset**, including:

#### üó≥Ô∏è **Nomos**
Used to simulate and prototype in-universe governance models, including multi-attribute decision-making and consent-based voting among diverse campus factions. Results are logged in-world and mirrored as Codex and Git contributions.

#### üí¨ **Waku**
Provides resilient, metadata-minimized communication between fictional characters and the real-world audience. Also used to simulate offline communications within the isolated campus enabling pseudonymous private chat, emergency broadcast protocols, and inter-faction messaging.

#### üìñ **Codex**
Supports collaborative authorship of the narrative and governance documentation. Community members can fork and contribute directly to the ‚Äúliving lore,‚Äù acting as fictional citizens or technical advisors within the experiment. This was originally envision as a Git based process but have an option for Codex storage is great for a privacy first alternative.

### Community Participation & Git Integration

This is not just a book ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **sandbox for simulation and contribution**. Readers and builders alike are invited to:
- Assume the role of campus residents or tech contributors
- Fork the narrative, propose changes to lore or governance
- Contribute pseudonymous blog posts, transcripts, or sketches
- Participate in voting processes to guide future story arcs

All of this happens on-chain or via Git, making each engagement a form of canonical participation.

Future plans for this work include a simulation engine to run different community managment structures.This idea could be expanded to help Cell members model their governance decisions and speed run outcomes in a sim city like enviornment based on a variety of templates (rural,urban, sea steading etc).

### Rollout Strategy

- **GitHub Repo**: Public campaign repository for lore, governance proposals, and tech stack discussions
- **Twitter Spaces / Farcaster Huddles**: "And that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre going..." sessions exploring themes and tech tie-ins
- **Animation & Multimedia**: Partnering with Forkin Wisdom for animated worldbuilding and scene drops
- **Collectibles**: On-chain artifacts, posts, and messages minted as NFTs (e.g., annotated surveillance clips, AI transcripts, node keys)
- **Workshop Circuits**: Community-run sessions on building parallel infrastructure (mesh networks, food sovereignty, local compute, etc.)

---

### Strategic Relevance to Logos

- A narrative-driven **onboarding and simulation tool** for Cells and communities
- Demonstrates Logos as infrastructure for both storytelling and sovereignty
- Bridges art, activism, and infrastructure through direct dogfooding
- Allows for ethical, consent-based data usage and non-extractive community engagement
- Publicly showcases how parallel societies can be more than metaphor ‚Äî they can be Git workflows
