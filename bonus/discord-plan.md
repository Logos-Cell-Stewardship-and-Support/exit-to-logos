# Logos Discord Management Plan

## üéØ Purpose

To establish the Logos Discord as a vibrant, mission-aligned community hub that lowers onboarding friction, rewards early participation, fosters valuable contributions, and evolves into a strategic platform for builder coordination, cultural transmission, and campaign activation.

---

## Phase 1: Open Access & Foundation Layer

### ‚úÖ Onboarding & Verification

- Gate entry using a simple verification captcha.
- Publicly state on the join page that Discord access will become role-gated later; early participants will retain privileges.
- Avoid announcing a specific member threshold to prevent bot farming or gaming.

### üè∑ Roles & Structure

- Minimize roles to essentials:
  - `@Operator` ‚Üí Global role for all verified community members.
  - `@Core Contributor` ‚Üí Internal coordination and stewardship.
  - Special earned roles (e.g. `@Meme Lord`, `@Writer`, `@Dev`, `@Cell Admin`, `@Multipass Holder`) to be added gradually based on meaningful participation.
- Simplify channel structure to prioritize clarity, action, and value delivery.

### üìö Orientation & Education

- Pin or embed essential "Logos 101" materials:
  - What is Logos?
  - What is an Operator?
  - Roadmap overview
  - Key links (e.g., docs, site, GitHub)
- Repeat mantras and cultural touchstones visibly across key channels.

---

## Phase 2: Activation & Culture-Building

### ü§ù Welcoming & Engagement

- Deploy two community stewards in staggered 12-hour shifts to:
  - Greet new members
  - Answer questions promptly
  - Maintain active, welcoming conversation
- Select stewards from early community members who exemplify constructive behavior.

### ‚ú® Guided Onboarding Survey

To better understand and support incoming members, present a short, interactive onboarding survey directly after verification.

**Sample prompts:**

1. **What brings you to Logos?**  
   _Select all that apply_:  
   - Tech/Infra Builder  
   - Organizer  
   - Ideology  
   - Curiosity  
   - Contributor  
   - Other  

2. **What would you like to help with?**  
   _Multiple choice_: Writing, Memes, Events, Development, Local Cells, Research, etc.

3. **How experienced are you with decentralized tech or web3?**  
   - New  
   - Somewhat  
   - Experienced  
   - Veteran  

4. **Do you want to join or start a Cell?**  
   - Yes  
   - Maybe  
   - Not Yet  

5. **What timezone are you in?**  
   _Dropdown or free text (e.g., UTC-4, EST)_

**Reward:**  
Upon completion, users receive the `@Operator` role and full access to community channels, updates, and opportunities.

### ü§ñ Local AI Support Agent

Deploy a locally hosted, privacy-respecting AI assistant that learns from public materials and survey responses to:

- Help members find the right channels, documents, and discussions
- Answer frequently asked questions (e.g. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the roadmap?‚Äù)
- Surface upcoming events and relevant proposals
- Suggest contribution pathways based on expressed interests

This assistant can be embedded within the Discord server via a lightweight, locally hosted bot that references Markdown docs or synced internal files. Avoid third-party APIs to maintain autonomy and trust.

## üèÜ Recognition & Contribution

### üéØ Contribution Pathways

Use a low-barrier engagement ladder model:

- Step 1: Say hello  
- Step 2: Ask questions  
- Step 3: React to posts / share memes  
- Step 4: Join a Cell / working group  
- Step 5: Organize or lead

No gamified targets ‚Äî reward sincere, consistent participation.

Create a dedicated **‚ÄúOpen Asks‚Äù** channel, pinned and updated regularly, to highlight current needs across writing, dev, ops, and organizing.

### üèÖ Recognition & Roles

- Celebrate meaningful contributions through:
  - Shout-outs by Core Contributors and founders
  - Featured content
  - Public recaps of valuable activity
- Grant earned roles (e.g., `@Writer`, `@Dev`, `@Meme Lord`) based on contribution type.
- Recognize `@Multipass Holders` and grant future cultural privileges or symbolic access.

Consider integrating XP or karma as a multiplier for future token drops, rewards, or governance privileges ‚Äî without incentivizing spam.

## Phase 3: Transition to Gated Access

### üîê Role-Gating

Once strong participation and cultural coherence are achieved:

- Announce Discord will become **role-gated**.
- Early Operators retain full access and act as peer onboarders.
- Newcomers will be required to:
  - Complete a survey
  - Get referred by a member
  - Hold a badge or proof-of-effort

### üß™ Community-Driven Iteration

- Use Discord as a testbed for meme formats, participation models, and engagement experiments.
- Gather feedback regularly through:
  - Community surveys
  - Feedback threads
  - Direct 1:1 steward conversations
- Use what works to inform:
  - The GTM strategy
  - Website design
  - Lore and creative assets
  - Internal tooling (e.g., Codex workflows)
