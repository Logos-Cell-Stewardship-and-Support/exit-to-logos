# Logos Developer Outreach Strategy

This is a call to the builders of new worlds. Logos is not just a vision—it's a working set of protocols ready to be extended, forked, and defended.

## 🔧 Key Outreach Pillars

### 💸 Ecosystem Grants
- Launch an *ongoing public call* for ecosystem development proposals.
- Focus on:
  - Infrastructure maintenance
  - Cell tooling
  - Integration with other FOSS or web3 stacks
- Publish grantee retrospectives to incentivize transparency and storytelling.
- Leverage **Ethereum Foundation grants alumni**, **Kernel fellows**, and similar communities of aligned builders to participate and contribute.

### 🐛 Bug Bounties & Hackathons
- Launch ongoing bug bounty programs to secure and harden Logos protocols.
- Partner with aligned orgs like [Web3 Privacy Now](https://web3privacy.info), ETHGlobal, and EF working groups to run **privacy-preserving hackathons**.
- Ensure that each major protocol milestone has a dev-focused bounty and event attached to it.

### 🎓 University Blockchain Clubs
- Tap into the growing network of **university blockchain clubs** that were supported through Gitcoin and Thrive.
- Offer:
  - Guest lectures on decentralized governance
  - Developer bounties for student-led projects
  - IRL meetups coordinated with local Cells
- Encourage multi-campus collaborations to test peer-to-peer infrastructure in real world conditions.

### 📚 Documentation
- Consolidate documentation into a single, well-structured portal.
- Include:
  - Getting started guides
  - Protocol specs
  - Tutorials
  - Visual explainers and example dapps
- All docs should be easy to fork, remix, and translate.
- Leverage contributors from Kernel and other writing-centric communities to improve clarity and educational tone.

### 🧑‍💻 GitHub Engagement
- Curate and highlight:
  - **Good First Issues**
  - **High Impact Issues**
  - **Cross-BU Collaboration Needs**
- Encourage contributors to self-organize with Labels like `#CellBuilt`, `#CC-Need`, `#Urgent`, `#Experimental`.

### 🧭 Mentorship Program
- Pair experienced Core Contributors (CCs) with developers eager to build.
- Host regular onboarding sessions and office hours in Discord.
- Offer educational pathways into:
  - Protocol design
  - Secure communications
  - Distributed publishing
  - DAO ops

### 🤝 Leverage Existing Networks
- Systematically activate:
  - Gitcoin and Thrive alumni networks
  - Kernel fellows
  - Ethereum Foundation grantees
  - Privacy-oriented dev DAOs and researchers
  - Peer nodes from Status and Waku-adjacent projects
- Cultivate alliances via shared docs, contributor shout-outs, and interop bounties.

### 🧬 IRL + Online Events
- Actively participate in FOSS, governance, and crypto events:
  - [Web3 Privacy Summit](https://web3privacy.info/)
  - [Devconnect](https://devconnect.org/)
  - [ETHDenver](https://www.ethdenver.com/)
  - [Parallel Societies Forum](https://twitter.com/Logos_network)
- Showcase use cases and give talks on decentralized civil resistance infrastructure.
- Bring Cells to meetups. Let the lore walk into the room.

## 📣 Earned Media + Developer CTAs

- Include **explicit developer CTAs** in every earned media, blog post, or tweet thread:
  - “Fork this”
  - “Deploy your Cell”
  - “Join the mentorship loop”
- Direct devs to the right places:
  - GitHub repos
  - Grants portal
  - Docs site
  - Event signups
  - **Locally run smart AI chatbots** in:
    - Discord (for async support and onboarding)
    - Website (for search, documentation, and help)

---

## 🛰 Channels

- Discord: Central for dev mentorship and async collab
- GitHub: Code and coordination
- Codex: Knowledge sharing, lore, and long-form
- Farcaster/X: Community and co-marketing

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Attract 20+ new dev contributors by end of Q3
- Launch 3 Cell-built tools/modules on top of the Logos stack
- Host 5+ educational livestreams or mentorship calls
- Publish 1 flagship open-source use case per month
- Formalize 3+ partnerships with student clubs, aligned DAOs, or privacy orgs

Let’s build what they said was impossible.
