# 🔐 Local LLMs, Shared Compute, and the Logos Laboratory Phase

_An initiative under the Exit to Logos campaign_

## Why This Matters

As we enter what can only be described as the **laboratory phase of parallel society development**, artificial intelligence—especially large language models (LLMs)—is becoming an increasingly critical layer of both **coordination** and **control**.

In this context, access to LLMs is not just a technical question. It is a **governance**, **privacy**, and **sovereignty** issue.

### The Problem: Centralized AI = Centralized Power

Most current LLM infrastructure is:

- **Centralized**: Controlled by a small number of corporations.
- **Opaque**: Users cannot inspect or understand what models are doing.
- **Surveilled**: Usage patterns, prompts, and outputs are logged.
- **Extractive**: Dependent on cloud APIs with unpredictable cost and access changes.

This makes AI a powerful vector for **surveillance capitalism**, **intellectual dependency**, and **behavioral control**—especially for communities attempting to operate outside the status quo.

### Our Opportunity: Local, Shared, Sovereign

As part of the Logos campaign, we propose launching a **distributed AI infrastructure initiative** that will:

- Support **local training and inference** of LLMs.
- Enable **secure remote access** to GPUs and compute clusters operated by trusted nodes.
- Encourage **cross-cell collaboration** around data curation, training, and fine-tuning.
- Maintain a commons-oriented, privacy-first repository of **training datasets**, **model weights**, and **deployment guides** tailored for Logos-aligned communities.

This aligns with the broader mission of Logos: building **parallel societies** with **parallel infrastructure**, rooted in **freedom**, **cooperation**, and **sovereignty**.

## 🧠 Phase 1: The Logos Model Commons

We propose the creation of a **Logos Model Commons**, consisting of:

- **Shared Repositories** for training data, scripts, and model weights.
- **Minimal Dependencies** and Dockerized deploy scripts for environments like [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/), [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/), and [RunPod](https://www.runpod.io/).
- **Metadata-Minimized Pipelines** with local logging only and no forced telemetry.
- **Consent-based contributions** to datasets from trusted peers and cells.

Data types may include:

- Decentralized governance conversations.
- Peer-to-peer learning transcripts.
- Knowledge from open-access research.
- Community tool manuals and code documentation.
- Indigenous and local knowledge (with explicit consent and access protocols).

## ⚙️ Phase 2: Shared Compute Pool

We will facilitate a **secure peer-to-peer GPU network** using trusted nodes across Logos-aligned communities.

- **Opt-in Nodes**: Individuals or groups can offer GPU time with bandwidth and access agreements.
- **Zero-Trust Containers**: Jobs run in sandboxed containers with signed logs and audit trails.
- **Scheduling Layer**: Lightweight coordination of jobs (e.g. via Nomos or Waku messaging layer).
- **Use Cases**: LLM inference, fine-tuning, simulations, bug coding, data processing.

This creates a “**Compute Commons**” for parallel societies—not dependent on AWS, Azure, or OpenAI infrastructure.

## 🔍 Use Cases in the Parallel Society Stack

- **Bug Coding & Vibe Development**: LLMs help rapidly prototype tooling for governance, communication, and coordination.
- **Local Language + Cultural Models**: Fine-tuned to reflect the nuance of a given Cell’s values, metaphors, and needs.
- **Narrative Autonomy**: AI writing and research assistants trained on community-approved content, rather than centralized corpora.
- **Educational Onramps**: Peer-led courses and tutoring powered by local models with no surveillance or data retention.
- **Resilience Simulations**: Scenario testing for infrastructure, governance experiments, or economic modeling.

## 📡 Security, Privacy, and Trust

Privacy is not a side feature—it’s the **foundation**.

- All LLM deployments will be **local-first** by default.
- No prompt data is ever sent to centralized APIs without explicit user opt-in.
- Datasets include **provenance tags** and **use constraints** (e.g. not for re-centralization or resale).
- Model updates are cryptographically signed by trusted stewards.

We are building the **most effective invisible infrastructure** ever seen—**not because it hides data, but because it doesn’t collect it in the first place.**

---

## 👣 Next Steps

We are calling for early contributors to help shape this initiative. You can:

- Donate GPU access or participate in the Compute Commons.
- Contribute datasets or help curate model-ready corpora.
- Help test model deployments on local or mesh networks.
- Co-design the governance structure for trusted sharing and access.

Please open an Issue or Discussion in this repo to join the working group.
