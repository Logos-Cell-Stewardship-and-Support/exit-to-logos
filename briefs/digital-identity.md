# Digital Identity Briefing – Exit to Logos Supplement

**Prepared by:** Exit to Logos Stewardship Team  
**Date:** June 2025  

---

## Purpose

This briefing outlines a strategic approach to **digital identity** that aligns with the goals of the *Exit to Logos* campaign: to build post-state legitimacy and activate a pseudonymous, privacy-respecting contributor community using decentralized, verifiable tools.

It is intended to guide implementation of an **opt-in engagement funnel** that prioritizes **sovereignty, safety, and composability** over surveillance, coercion, or centralized gatekeeping.

---

## Context: Why Identity Matters

Traditional engagement funnels—campaign CRMs, newsletters, gated communities—rely on email lists, tracking pixels, and coercive data capture. These systems violate user trust and replicate extractive dynamics.

**Exit to Logos** seeks to invert this model. We want:

- *Pseudonymity with accountability*
- *Proof without KYC*
- *Trust without invasive metrics*

Digital identity is not a branding exercise or a login system. It's **political infrastructure**—and we must treat it with the gravity it deserves.

---

## Principles for Identity Infrastructure

1. **Optional and Modular**  
   Participation should not require deanonymization. Users should opt-in to any tracking or verification mechanisms, with **clear benefits** for doing so.

2. **Sybil Resistance Without Surveillance**  
   Use Waku-enabled social graphs, reputation data, and subgraph queries to establish contextual trust. Combine with proof-of-personhood schemes *without central authorities*.

3. **Self-Hosted, Composable Reputation**  
   Users should own their attestations and host their reputation state—stored in Codex, indexed via Subgraph, and optionally mirrored to ENS, Farcaster, etc.

4. **Interoperable, Not Interchangeable**  
   No one-size-fits-all DID or wallet registry. Identity should be portable across contexts, but *not flattened* into a singular metric.

## Strategic Tools and Integrations

| Tool | Role | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| **Holonym** | zkKYC, proof-of-clean-hands | Promising zk-native identity layer |
| **Proof of Humanity v2** | Lightweight uniqueness without surveillance | Requires monitoring for gameability |
| **GitHub / Farcaster / ENS handles** | Optional linkage | Provides pseudonymous public trust |
| **Waku Social Graph** | Messaging + Sybil resistance | Useful for reputation-building and behavior signals |
| **Subgraph Indexes** | Data aggregation and querying | Enables decentralized analytics without central tracking |
| **Nomos** | Governance and proposal voting | Enables role-gated participation with proof-of-hands |

## Antagonists: What We’re Pushing Against

| Project | Concern |
|---------|---------|
| **Worldcoin / World ID** | Biometric data collection + honeypot risk |
| **Discord-based gating** | Email capture and surveillance capitalism |
| **Google / Meta CRM tools** | Extractive design, no user sovereignty |
| **Token-based Sybil gates** | Encourages rent-seeking and plutocracy |

Worldcoin’s rebrand as “World” doesn’t change its central flaw: surveillance is not sovereignty. We reject biometric centralization as inherently incompatible with Logos values.

## Practical Funnel Design (Diagram Optional)

1. **Initial Contact**  
   - Anonymous participation: no login required  
   - Optional social linkage (e.g., GitHub, Farcaster, Lens)  

2. **Frictionless Engagement**  
   - Propose ideas, remix lore, participate in RPG  
   - Earn XP or rep in local simulations  

3. **Proof of Hands / Impact Layer**  
   - Submit commits, steward cells, vote in Nomos  
   - Unlock deeper privileges or signals of trust  

4. **Opt-In Attestations**  
   - Prove uniqueness, values alignment, or community endorsements  
   - Store in Codex or portable wallets  

5. **Reputation Sharing**  
   - Mint achievements as NFTs or link rep graphs  
   - Plug into Farcaster frames, GitHub showcases, or on-chain credentials

## Downstream Risks + Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Centralization of identity data | Encourage local hosting and self-issued proofs |
| Surveillance creep | Avoid third-party APIs for core auth flows |
| Rep farming or sockpuppeting | Combine behavior + graph signals (Waku/Subgraph) |
| Trust collapse due to sybil attacks | Blend soft reputational signals with local verification |

---

## Final Thoughts

In a world of forced surveillance and extractive identity rails, the Exit to Logos campaign must lead by example. We will:

- Dogfood our stack for identity and trust.
- Offer opt-in participation that respects dignity.
- Reject biometric coercion and surveillance capitalism.
- Build pluralistic, composable identity systems *with the community*.

The goal is not to know everything about everyone—it is to help people build trust, collaborate, and govern without compromising their sovereignty.

→ *Pseudonymity is not a bug. It’s a survival strategy.*
