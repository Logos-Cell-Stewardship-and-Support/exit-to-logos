### Overview

*Mandate: The Mimulus Experiment* — also referred to as *The Monkey Flower Experiment* — is a participatory fiction project authored by Ben West, set approximately five years into the future. The story unfolds on a mountain university campus that becomes isolated from the outside world following an environmental catastrophe, leaving students, staff, and local residents to self-organize and survive over the course of a year. This contained social experiment explores the intersections of decentralized governance, technological infrastructure, and cultural friction — a "Lord of the Flies" for the distributed systems era.

Originally conceived as a student-led theatrical project at Capilano University in the early 2000s, the work has evolved into a multimedia speculative fiction narrative now being developed as a full-length interactive novel and open-source community storytelling platform.

### Narrative Structure

The book is written entirely through:
- Blog posts and journal entries
- Decentralized social media threads
- Meeting transcripts and governance wikis
- Surveillance footage summaries and system logs
- In-universe AI-generated summaries, simulations, and forecasts

This structure simulates the fragmented, polyvocal experience of life inside an emergent parallel society — and mirrors real-world decentralized networks of information and decision-making.

---

### Themes

- The tension between centralized control and decentralized resilience
- Cultural, economic, and power asymmetries in post-crisis governance
- The role of local compute, mesh networks, and cryptographic identity
- Governance experiments, failure modes, and institutional memory
- Parallel societies as necessity, not utopia

### Tech Stack (Refactored to Dogfood Logos)

Originally envisioned as a localized mesh of Raspberry Pi nodes running a custom blockchain and forum software, the new version of the Mimulus infrastructure stack has been re-architected to fully **dogfood the Logos toolset**, including:

#### 🗳️ **Nomos**
Used to simulate and prototype in-universe governance models — including multi-attribute decision-making and consent-based voting among diverse campus factions. Results are logged in-world and mirrored as Git contributions.

#### 💬 **Waku**
Provides resilient, metadata-minimized communication between fictional characters and the real-world audience. Also used to simulate offline communications within the isolated campus — enabling pseudonymous private chat, emergency broadcast protocols, and inter-faction messaging.

#### 📖 **Codex**
Supports collaborative authorship of the narrative and governance documentation. Community members can fork and contribute directly to the “living lore,” acting as fictional citizens or technical advisors within the experiment.

#### 🔐 **Optional Add-ons**
- **Holonym** or other zk-ID systems for reputation scoring or access gating
- **Ceramic/IPFS** for storing decentralized identity and media content
- **GitHub Discussions** as public, federated deliberation mirror

### Community Participation & Git Integration

This is not just a book — it’s a **sandbox for simulation and contribution**. Readers and builders alike are invited to:
- Assume the role of campus residents or tech contributors
- Fork the narrative, propose changes to lore or governance
- Contribute pseudonymous blog posts, transcripts, or sketches
- Participate in voting processes to guide future story arcs

All of this happens on-chain or via Git, making each engagement a form of canonical participation.

---

### Rollout Strategy

- **GitHub Repo**: Public campaign repository for lore, governance proposals, and tech stack discussions
- **Twitter Spaces / Farcaster Huddles**: "And that’s why we’re going..." sessions exploring themes and tech tie-ins
- **Animation & Multimedia**: Partnering with Fork & Wisdom for animated worldbuilding and scene drops
- **Collectibles**: On-chain artifacts, posts, and messages minted as NFTs (e.g., annotated surveillance clips, AI transcripts, node keys)
- **Workshop Circuits**: Community-run sessions on building parallel infrastructure (mesh networks, food sovereignty, local compute, etc.)

---

### Strategic Relevance to Logos

- A narrative-driven **onboarding and simulation tool** for Cells and communities
- Demonstrates Logos as infrastructure for both storytelling and sovereignty
- Bridges art, activism, and infrastructure through direct dogfooding
- Allows for ethical, consent-based data usage and non-extractive community engagement
- Publicly showcases how parallel societies can be more than metaphor — they can be Git workflows

### Call to Action

Help us test this future.

> Fork the repo.  
> Write from inside the story.  
> Build the tools that let us escape the page.
