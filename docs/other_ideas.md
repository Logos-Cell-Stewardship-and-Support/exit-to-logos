# Supplementary Campaign Ideas – Exit to Logos

**Prepared by:** Exit Stewardship Team  
**Last updated:** June 2025  

---

## Purpose

This document contains secondary and experimental campaign ideas that can complement the primary “Exit to Logos” strategy. These are **modular**, **testable**, and **community-co-creatable**, but not essential to launch.

They serve as a **menu of future directions** or tactical experiments for the Logos ecosystem and may be selectively adopted based on cell capacity, funding, and timing. This can be forked, expanded or ignored.

## 1. Simulation Layer: Operator RPG Extensions

- Build on the Operator RPG from the core campaign plan.
- Add modular plugins:
  - **Supply chain collapse scenarios**
  - **Energy resilience simulation (Codex + solar grid tokens)**
  - **Borderless dispute resolution engine**
- Implement experience-based voting rights, roles, or badges.
- Consider integration with Farcaster Frames, Lens NFTs, or Codex-hosted digital maps.

*Rationale:* Encourages long-term thinking, prepares builders to simulate failure modes and community stress-testing.

---

## 2. Mintable Media + Participation NFTs

- Mintable blog posts, lore drops, and community badges.
- Allow for remixing, comments, and rep-earning through:
  - On-chain publishing platforms (e.g., Mirror, Paragraph, Zora)
  - Waku-based or IPFS-hosted art exchanges
- Prototype with Git-based publishing and optional token minting via Codex/Nomos.

*Rationale:* Makes participation legible, collectible, and potentially composable into contributor rep across the stack.

---

## 3. Meetup and Mesh Activation

- Sponsor or lightly guide in-person or LAN-based meetups in key hubs (e.g., Oaxaca, Porto, Berlin).
- Focus on:
  - Local storytelling
  - Off-grid mesh comms testing (e.g., Waku, Briar, LoRa)
  - Tactical solidarity between movements
- Support toolkits for neighborhood deployments and flash community infrastructure.

*Rationale:* Makes the Logos stack tangible, locally rooted, and resistant to infrastructure failure.

---

## 4. Meme Strategy + Lore Fractals

- Launch a decentralized “Lore Fractal” team:
  - Create meme assets, aesthetic packs, and remixable branding elements
  - Archive participatory lore on Codex
  - Allow minting of fictional proposals and simulated wins
- Encourage propagation of key slogans:
  - *Exit isn’t escape—it’s rehearsal.*
  - *Protocols are rituals.*
  - *We are the network.*

*Rationale:* Culture precedes adoption. Lore lowers the barrier to entry and builds emotional affinity.

---

## 5. Convergent Summits / Cross-Pollination

- Facilitate cross-stack working groups with:
  - Coordinape, Gitcoin, Gnosis Guild, Radicle, Holochain, Scuttlebutt, etc.
- Invite participation from trustless systems outside crypto:
  - Platform co-ops, community currencies, permatech networks
- Consider a co-located event before or after the Parallel Societies Conference.

*Rationale:* Expand mindshare and contribute to a pluralistic stack that survives tribalism.

---

## 6. Build-Your-Own-Network-State Toolkit

- Reframe network states as **exit-friendly cells**, not state-seeking platforms.
- Offer:
  - Forkable governance templates (Nomos)
  - Communications mesh nodes (Waku)
  - Distributed archives and CRMs (Codex)
  - Storytelling + legitimacy guides (Lore + RPG + Attestations)
- Include strategy primers on:
  - Non-plutocratic funding models
  - Decentralized dispute resolution
  - Disaster resilience and mutual aid

*Rationale:* Gives non-crypto communities a gateway into Logos infrastructure, through a narrative they recognize.

## Notes

- This list will evolve based on **cell feedback** and **tooling maturity**.
- Inclusion here does not mean execution—each item is subject to resourcing, capacity, and cell stewardship interest.
