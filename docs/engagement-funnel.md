- Mirror articles and podcast interviews

**Metrics:**

- Impressions per campaign asset
- Shares, bookmarks, quote-tweets
- Web traffic to campaign repo and docs

## Notes

This funnel is intentionally *permeable* and *forkable*. Contributors should feel empowered to enter at any point, remix the structure, or design parallel paths suited to their own exit strategies.
