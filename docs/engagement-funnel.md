# Engagement Funnel: From Curiosity to Cell Stewardship  
*Invisible & Ephemeral by Design*  
**Supplement to the Exit to Logos Campaign**  
**Prepared by:** Exit Stewardship Team  
**Date:** June 2025  

---

## 🧭 Summary

This engagement funnel guides individuals from first contact to active participation in Logos Cells, based on values of **voluntary association**, **privacy**, and **shared narrative**. Unlike traditional funnels, this one is **ephemeral, consent-based**, and **invisible by design**—a pattern language for decentralized growth.

There is no pressure to convert—only an invitation to co-create.

We call this the **non-funnel funnel**: a library of porous rituals, symbolic artifacts, and narrative signals that propagate autonomy without central control.

---

## 🎯 Core Objectives

- **Expand and empower Cells**—support their emergence, survival, and cultural depth  
- **Foster genuine participation** without coercive incentives or extractive logic  
- **Use the Logos stack (Codex, Waku, Nomos)** to coordinate and support opt-in contributions  
- **Track meaningful KPIs** that reflect values-aligned activity, not vanity metrics

## 🌀 Invisible & Consent-Based Stages

### 1. 👀 Curiosity (Awareness)

> *“What is Logos? Who are these people?”*

**Tactics**  
- Lore-rich social content and memes (non-prescriptive)  
- Narrative explainers (e.g. “Exit isn’t secession—it’s substitution”)  
- Field reports and testimonials from Cells  
- Ephemeral zines, PDFs, or digital lore drops  

**Tools**  
- Waku relays (for story fragments and media pings)  
- Codex (for living lore libraries and remixable artifacts)  
- Custom portals, zine mirrors, and shortlinks  

**KPI Targets**  
- `10,000+` unique site/lore interactions per quarter  
- `2,000+` reposts or shares of lore artifacts  
- `6+` new audience segments reached (by theme or geography)  

---

### 2. 🧭 Engagement (Signal of Interest)

> *“I’d like to learn more or help.”*

**Tactics**  
- Join a Cell circle, lore game, or async RPG session  
- Contribute to zines, memes, or symbolic rituals  
- Co-create digital or physical lore artifacts  

**Tools**  
- Waku chat (ephemeral, private)  
- Codex submissions (pseudonymous by default)  
- Nomos for non-token-based input and proposals  

**KPI Targets**  
- `500+` contributors engaged by Q1 2026  
- `100+` original lore contributions or remixes  
- `50+` Cells report engagement sparked by funnel  

---

### 3. 🛠️ Participation (Co-Creation)

> *“I’m actively building something here.”*

**Tactics**  
- Launch or support a new Cell  
- Host field simulations or collaborative lore games  
- Share governance experiments or decentralized rituals  

**Tools**  
- Codex (versioned lore, reports, and artifacts)  
- Nomos (proposal templates, transparent deliberation)  
- Waku (comms mesh between Cells)  

**KPI Targets**  
- `50+` active Cells reporting progress  
- `150+` creative outputs documented and shared  
- `30+` governance prototypes captured in lore  

---

### 4. 🌀 Stewardship (Narrative Infrastructure)

> *“I want to help others shape and sustain this.”*

**Tactics**  
- Mentor new Cells or contributors  
- Help standardize lore templates and ritual scaffolds  
- Host inter-Cell sessions and lore exchanges  

**Tools**  
- Codex (reputation and lore continuity tools)  
- Nomos (non-token signaling and mentorship support)  
- Waku subnetworks for cross-Cell propagation  

**KPI Targets**  
- `25+` identified lorekeepers and stewards  
- `5+` cross-Cell anthologies or collaborative publications  
- `80%+` contributor alignment (self-reported via optional surveys)

## 📉 Measurement Without Surveillance

| Area | Metric |
|------|--------|
| Consentful Participation | Toolkit downloads, RPG signups, Matrix/Waku opt-ins |
| Cell Activation | New Cells using Codex/Waku/Nomos |
| Narrative Reach | Lore reactions, mints, Codex citations |
| Community Health | Returning contributors, zine collabs, RPG feedback |
| Protocol Dogfooding | Waku messages, Nomos proposals, Codex activity |

> No persistent cookies. No behavioral profiling. Just signal over noise.

## 🔐 Privacy + Consent Design

- **Waku**: ephemeral, metadata-minimized communication  
- **Codex**: opt-in, pseudonymous publishing and indexing  
- **Nomos**: consensus tooling without token-based hierarchy  
- **Matrix/Farcaster**: burner-friendly bridges for early contact  
- **No email traps, centralized CRMs, or ad trackers**

## 🫧 Meta-Principles

- **Ephemeral + Optional** → Invisible infrastructure, visible coordination  
- **Non-Linear Paths** → Join, exit, rejoin freely  
- **Consent > Conversion** → Participation is the only goal  
- **Lore > Loyalty** → Shared culture, not centralized authority  
- **Transparent & Forkable** → Everything observable and remixable

## 📉 Traditional Funnel vs Invisible Funnel

| Traditional Funnel           | Logos Funnel                         |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Email capture               | Anonymous participation               |
| Analytics and tracking      | Local metrics, consentful signals     |
| Conversion-focused          | Culture-first, lore-centered          |
| Centralized platforms       | Federated, self-hosted, mirrored      |
| Extractive incentives       | Symbolic, opt-in, values-aligned      |

## 🧠 Philosophy

> *Privacy is not an obstacle to participation—it’s a precondition for freedom.*  
> *We don’t recruit. We resonate.*  
> *We don’t convert. We co-create.*  

**Exit isn’t escape. It’s emergence.**

→ *Exit to Logos. Enter the lore.*
