# Digital Identity Briefing – Supplement to the Exit to Logos Campaign

**Prepared by:** Exit Stewardship Team  
**Date:** June 2025  

---

## Summary

This briefing outlines an identity strategy to support the **expansion and coordination of Logos Cells**, in alignment with the Exit to Logos campaign goals. Rather than defaulting to centralized CRMs or biometric “proof-of-humanity” schemes, we propose a modular, **opt-in system of pseudonymous reputation**, enabling community trust and engagement without coercion.

This infrastructure will support:
- **Case study sharing** and lore propagation between cells
- **Lightweight Sybil resistance**
- **Trust-building for contributors and decision-making**
- Metrics aligned with real-world impact, not surveillance

---

## Strategic Objectives

1. **Empower new and existing cells** with optional tooling for collaboration, trust, and storytelling.
2. **Avoid surveillance-based systems** by designing for consent, pseudonymity, and self-hosting.
3. **Enable discovery and interoperability** via decentralized identity primitives (e.g. Waku social graph).
4. **Measure legitimacy by contribution, not compliance.**

---

## Core Campaign Fit

The identity layer is **not the product**—it's scaffolding to support what matters: **cells doing meaningful work** and **sharing their learnings**. This proposal connects directly to:

- **Cell expansion KPIs**  
- **Narrative propagation and lore building**  
- **Contributor onboarding + coordination**  
- **Decentralized, values-aligned infrastructure**

This approach **dogfoods Logos’ own stack** (Waku, Codex, Nomos), aligning our practices with our principles.

---

## Principles

- **Voluntary**: No identity system is required to participate.
- **Modular**: Tools should be plug-and-play, not monolithic.
- **Privacy-Preserving**: No biometric data, no centralized attestations.
- **Forkable**: Cells should be able to run their own verification or reputation processes.
- **Composable**: Reputation can be carried across contexts, if chosen.

## Tools and Infrastructure

| Tool | Use Case | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Waku** | Share social graph + rep signals | Used for consent-based reputation messaging |
| **Subgraph Indexes** | Behavior-based Sybil resistance | Lightweight on-chain or off-chain behavior tracking |
| **Holonym** | zkKYC or proof-of-clean-hands | Optional opt-in for cells requiring regulatory assurance |
| **Codex** | Self-hosted reputation or contribution logs | Cell-based and sovereign |
| **Nomos** | Gated participation based on rep or trust level | Used for deliberation, not exclusion |

---

## Funnel Design (Optional Participation)

1. **Initial Entry**  
   - Join a cell or follow project updates anonymously
   - No login or ID needed

2. **Engagement**  
   - Optional linking of GitHub, Farcaster, or Wallet
   - Earn rep by contributing to lore, proposals, code

3. **Optional Verification**  
   - Cell-specific attestations (skill, contribution, trust)
   - Proof-of-clean-hands or uniqueness only where necessary

4. **Portable Identity Layer**  
   - Users may export rep/NFTs via Codex + Subgraph for use across Logos tools
   - Opt-in visibility and linkage only

## Key Metrics (Aligned with Campaign KPIs)

| Metric | Target | Tool |
|--------|--------|------|
| Number of active cells using identity tooling | 10+ by Q2 2026 | Waku + Nomos integration |
| % of contributors using portable reputation | 25% of active contributors | Codex / GitHub badges |
| Number of opt-in attestations or mints | 500+ by Parallel Societies Conference | Nomos proposals + optional NFT |
| Number of cell-to-cell collaborations enabled | 20+ joint projects | Reputation-facilitated matchmaking |
| % of participants using pseudonyms | > 50% | Privacy-preserving by default |

---

## Differentiation from Surveillance Models

| Feature | Surveillance CRM | Exit to Logos Identity |
|---------|------------------|-------------------------|
| **Consent** | Opt-out, forced capture | 100% opt-in |
| **Storage** | Centralized cloud databases | Distributed via Codex or cell-led |
| **Usage** | Targeting, segmentation | Collaboration, governance, lore |
| **Verification** | KYC, phone/email | Contribution, rep, community trust |
| **Privacy** | Tracked | Pseudonymous by default |

---

## Storytelling as Identity

Rather than static IDs or scores, we propose that identity is a **narrative artifact**:

- Case studies from cells act as trust signals.
- Rep emerges from shared story, not metrics alone.
- “Lore” becomes the connective tissue across contributors.

By minting or indexing these stories, contributors create **living reputation trails** tied to real coordination—not just on-chain actions.

---

## Final Notes

This identity approach supports **stewardship over surveillance**. It aligns with Logos' values and enables a regenerative culture of:

- **Co-creation** (opt-in collaboration)
- **Consent** (no forced onboarding)
- **Continuity** (portable reputation)
- **Cell sovereignty** (each group defines its own practices)

This identity scaffold is only what is needed, and **no more**.

> Trust is not tracked—it’s earned, shared, and storied.
