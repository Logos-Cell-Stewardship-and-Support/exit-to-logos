## 📣 Tactical Plan (Multichannel)

The Exit to Logos campaign runs on trust, not tracking. This is a privacy-preserving, tool-driven funnel with no telemetry, no hidden analytics, and no extractive onboarding. Our goals are measurable, our outputs are public, and our infrastructure is free to fork.

---

### Phase 1: Cell Toolkit Launch & Outreach (Weeks 1–2)

**🎯 Objective:**  
Distribute a fully functional toolkit for Cell formation, lore creation, and secure comms—then amplify early adopters and build momentum through trust-based outreach.

**📦 Deliverables:**

- **Public GitHub Repository:**
  - `/toolkit/` folder containing:
    - Cell Starter Guide (opsec, governance, lore hooks, Waku setup)
    - Nomos Voting How-To (with prebuilt templates)
    - Codex Publishing Starter Kit (lore logs, zines, proposals)
    - RPG Launch Pack (rules, prompts, coordination protocols)
  - `/lore/` directory seeded with sample content and media
  - `/tasks/` board with first bounties and contributor onboarding

- **Privacy & Security Emphasis:**
  - Waku comms templates for secure Cell setup
  - Instructions for air-gapped onboarding and pseudonymous collaboration
  - No Google Forms, no data retention—only Git and Waku logs

**📡 Outreach & Engagement:**

- Direct DMs to governance hackers, lorecrafters, and infra maintainers on:
  - Discord, Twitter/X, Farcaster, Lens
- AMA hosted via Discord public stream (RPG kickoff, dev Q&A)
- Loom-style walk-through of toolkit and Cell setup demo

**📈 Metrics:**
- 10+ Cells onboarded and operational in first two months.
- 5 Cells fork and modify toolkit with commits or PRs
- 3 external contributors added to toolkit documentation team

### Phase 2: Dogfooding the Exit Stack (Weeks 3–6)

**🎯 Objective:**  
Build public legitimacy and internal coordination capacity by using Logos tools in real Cell coordination and community lore development.

**🔧 Implementation:**

- **Waku Messaging Rollout:**
  - 10+ Cells set up secure Waku channels for daily coordination
  - RPG channels hosted over Waku for lore immersion + ops simulation
  - Matrix fallback rooms with minimal metadata exposure

- **Nomos Pilots:**
  - At least 5 Cells run internal votes using Nomos
  - Simulated funding, lore-based proposals, and governance experiments
  - Reflections published pseudonymously via Codex or GitHub Pages

- **Codex Archiving:**
  - RPG logs, lore zines, governance outcomes published to Codex
  - 20+ lore entries mapped to RPG decisions
  - Option to mint commemorative pages (Proof of Participation)

- **Simulation Season:**
  - Operator RPG Season One
    - Participants take on rotating lore/infra roles
    - XP earned through lore posts, coordination, and contribution
    - Nomos voting shapes next episode and faction dynamics

**📈 Metrics:**
- 15+ contributors submit lore, governance ideas, or tool feedback
- 100+ RPG decisions made and logged publicly
- 200+ Codex reads or forks of lore content

  - Publish highlights reel, lore drops, and tool adoption stats

- **Exit Funnel Activation:**
  - Remixable onboarding frames and RPG invites
  - Farcaster lore contests and GitHub onboarding quests
  - Calls for next cohort of Cells: “Fork the Future”

**📈 Metrics:**
- 25+ Cells publicly documented or archived in Codex
- 10 lore zine articles published from independent Cells

## 🤝 Contributor Funnel (Invisible, but Real)

- No Discord bots, no pixel trackers.
- Onboarding happens through Waku, lore invites, GitHub, email opt ins and word of mouth.
- Identity is optional and reputation is earned through action.

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🧙 Lorekeepers | Contribute story arcs, zines, and RPG flavor |
| 🛠️ Infra Guides | Help new Cells deploy Waku, Codex, Nomos |
| 🕸️ Bridgebuilders | Recruit and support new contributors via social channels |
| 🎲 RPG Hosts | Run narrative + governance sessions across timezones |

- GitHub issues become task boards (via Labels + Projects)
- Contributions feed directly into Nomos simulations (e.g., contributor consensus models)

## 🔐 Privacy Is the Premise

This campaign is a funnel with no surveillance.

- **No google analytics**
- **No tracking pixels**
- **No Discord scraping**

We grow by consent, not coercion.
