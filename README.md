# Exit to Logos: Campaign Strategy Hub

**Exit to Logos** is more than a campaign‚Äîit‚Äôs a coordinated leap toward a future where autonomy, privacy, and peer-to-peer governance are not ideals, but lived realities. This repository serves as the digital staging ground for that campaign, anchoring resources, lore, and activation materials for contributors around the world.

## ‚úçÔ∏è About Me

I'm **Ben West**, a campaign strategist, community organizer, and movement builder with over 25 years of experience across activism, operations, media relations, and policy-oriented political work. I've helped grow decentralized projects, coordinate distributed teams, and design tools that support self-determined communities.

I'm excited about the Campaign Director role because Logos embodies the principles I‚Äôve worked toward for decades: consent-based coordination, resilient infrastructure, and cultural systems that empower rather than extract. This plan reflects how I would approach the work‚Äîclear-eyed, collaborative, and focused on building something enduring across borders and protocols.
