# Exit to Logos: Campaign Strategy Plan

> **Status:** Draft Submission for Logos Campaign Director Assignment  
> **Submitted by:** Ben West (potential Campaign Director, Exit to Logos Steward)

---

## 🧭 Summary

This campaign strategy outlines a multichannel plan to activate and support the growth of Cells (real-world and digital communities) using the full Logos stack: **Nomos** (consensus), **Codex** (storage), and **Waku** (messaging). The goal is to build legitimacy for Logos as foundational infrastructure for emerging parallel societies by embedding its protocols in real-world use and storytelling.

The plan centers on recruiting and resourcing new and existing Cells with support tools, narrative amplification, and participatory co-creation, culminating in real-world outcomes aligned with the Parallel Societies Conference. The campaign is designed to be pluralistic, privacy-respecting, and anti-feudal, with opt-in infrastructure and minimal bureaucracy.

## 🧱 Campaign Narrative

> "We don’t need to wait for permission to govern ourselves. We can Exit to Logos now."

Rather than competing in the broken legitimacy contests of legacy governance, we focus on implementation: helping real people use real tools to coordinate, publish, and communicate in the ways they choose.

This campaign amplifies the stories and systems of people already building parallel societies. Through Cells and lore, governance experiments and protocols, we tell a story of freedom in practice—not as utopia, but as infrastructure.

---

## 🎯 Why Start Here?

- Cells are the beating heart of Logos. Supporting them means showing Logos at work.
- These stories are real, measurable, and urgent.
- The campaign becomes a testing ground for Nomos, Waku, and Codex.
- Seasonality creates time-bound momentum (aligned with the Parallel Societies Conference).

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Target Audiences

| Avatar | Description | Needs | Why This Resonates |
|--------|-------------|-------|---------------------|
| **María the Movement Builder** | Grassroots org leader moving from social to sovereign tech | Credible, usable tools; community | Exit without burnout; tech that respects her people |
| **Omar the Optimistic Engineer** | Builder who sees Web3 as more than speculation | A cause, good teammates | Can contribute to real-world deployments |
| **Talia the Teacher** | Governance facilitator and lore keeper | Ways to teach, visualize and simulate | RPG and lore bring meaning, not just code |
| **Jin the Jaded DAOist** | Former core contributor burnt by capture | A fresh start, no empty vibes | Anti-feudal + pluralism == curiosity rekindled |
| **Anjali the Privacy Punk** | Activist aligned with EFF / Tor / Matrix values | Trustworthy tools, not just blockchain hype | Waku dogfooding + pseudonymous engagement |

---

## 🛠 Protocol Focus

**All Three Protocols** will be dogfooded in the process:

- **Waku**: for asynchronous, resilient, pseudonymous communication between Cells
- **Codex**: shared publishing, lore archiving, and protocol documentation
- **Nomos**: optional opt-in consensus for Cells' internal governance or inter-Cell decision-making

_Optional integrations_: Holonym, social/subgraph for trust scores, Git-based lore publishing

---

## 📣 Tactical Plan (Multichannel)

### Phase 1: Cell Support Kit Launch

- Publish campaign repo with toolkit, lore builder, call-to-action
- DM outreach to key avatars via Farcaster, Twitter, Matrix
- AMA with Logos contributors + public Loom walkthrough

### Phase 2: Cell Amplification + Protocol Dogfooding

- Waku onboarding events (secure channels + lore/ops coordination)
- Seasonal RPG simulations using lore governance scenarios
- Codex archives of RPG outcomes + proposals
- Nomos pilots for Cells that want opt-in decision tooling

### Phase 3: Parallel Societies Convergence

- Showcase Cell outcomes, lore, and learnings
- Public minting of proof-of-governance moments
- Shared ‘Exit Atlas’ lore zine published via Codex + Git
- On-chain engagement funnel to bring in new contributors

_Channels_: GitHub, Twitter/X, Farcaster, Lens, Matrix, Discord, Email

---

## 🤝 Volunteer + Contributor Funnel

- Create opt-in onboarding using Waku-based identity, lore roles, and RPG choices
- Seasonal roles: Lorekeepers, Bridgebuilders, RPG Hosts, Infra Guides
- Git-based task boards with contributor bounties (easy-to-join flow)
- Nomos used to simulate contributions-to-consensus pathways
