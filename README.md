# Exit to Logos: Campaign Strategy Plan

> **Status:** Draft Submission for Logos Campaign Director Assignment  
> **Submitted by:** Ben West (potential Campaign Director, Exit to Logos Steward)

---

## 🧭 Summary

This campaign strategy outlines a multichannel plan to activate and support the growth of Cells (real-world and digital communities) using the full Logos stack: **Nomos** (consensus), **Codex** (storage), and **Waku** (messaging). The goal is to build legitimacy for Logos as foundational infrastructure for emerging parallel societies by embedding its protocols in real-world use and storytelling.

The plan centers on recruiting and resourcing new and existing Cells with support tools, narrative amplification, and participatory co-creation, culminating in real-world outcomes aligned with the Parallel Societies Conference. The campaign is designed to be pluralistic, privacy-respecting, and anti-feudal, with opt-in infrastructure and minimal bureaucracy.

---

## 🧱 Campaign Narrative

> "We don’t need to wait for permission to govern ourselves. We can Exit to Logos now."

Rather than competing in the broken legitimacy contests of legacy governance, we focus on implementation: helping real people use real tools to coordinate, publish, and communicate in the ways they choose.

This campaign amplifies the stories and systems of people already building parallel societies. Through Cells and lore, governance experiments and protocols, we tell a story of freedom in practice—not as utopia, but as infrastructure.

---

## 🎯 Why Start Here?

- Cells are the beating heart of Logos. Supporting them means showing Logos at work.
- These stories are real, measurable, and urgent.
- The campaign becomes a testing ground for Nomos, Waku, and Codex.
- Seasonality creates time-bound momentum (aligned with the Parallel Societies Conference).

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Target Audiences

| Avatar | Description | Needs | Why This Resonates |
|--------|-------------|-------|---------------------|
| **María the Movement Builder** | Grassroots org leader moving from social to sovereign tech | Credible, usable tools; community | Exit without burnout; tech that respects her people |
| **Omar the Optimistic Engineer** | Builder who sees Web3 as more than speculation | A cause, good teammates | Can contribute to real-world deployments |
| **Talia the Teacher** | Governance facilitator and lore keeper | Ways to teach, visualize and simulate | RPG and lore bring meaning, not just code |
| **Jin the Jaded DAOist** | Former core contributor burnt by capture | A fresh start, no empty vibes | Anti-feudal + pluralism == curiosity rekindled |
| **Anjali the Privacy Punk** | Activist aligned with EFF / Tor / Matrix values | Trustworthy tools, not just blockchain hype | Waku dogfooding + pseudonymous engagement |

---

## 🛠 Protocol Focus

**All Three Protocols** will be dogfooded in the process:

- **Waku**: for asynchronous, resilient, pseudonymous communication between Cells
- **Codex**: shared publishing, lore archiving, and protocol documentation
- **Nomos**: optional opt-in consensus for Cells' internal governance or inter-Cell decision-making

_Optional integrations_: Holonym, social/subgraph for trust scores, Git-based lore publishing

---

## 📣 Tactical Plan (Multichannel)

The Exit to Logos campaign runs on trust, not tracking. This is a privacy-preserving, tool-driven funnel with no telemetry, no hidden analytics, and no extractive onboarding. Our goals are measurable, our outputs are public, and our infrastructure is free to fork.

---

### Phase 1: Cell Toolkit Launch & Outreach (Weeks 1–2)

**🎯 Objective:**  
Distribute a fully functional toolkit for Cell formation, lore creation, and secure comms—then amplify early adopters and build momentum through trust-based outreach.

**📦 Deliverables:**

- **Public GitHub Repository:**
  - `/toolkit/` folder containing:
    - Cell Starter Guide (opsec, governance, lore hooks, Waku setup)
    - Nomos Voting How-To (with prebuilt templates)
    - Codex Publishing Starter Kit (lore logs, zines, proposals)
    - RPG Launch Pack (rules, prompts, coordination protocols)
  - `/lore/` directory seeded with sample content and media
  - `/tasks/` board with first bounties and contributor onboarding

- **Privacy & Security Emphasis:**
  - Waku comms templates for secure Cell setup
  - Instructions for air-gapped onboarding and pseudonymous collaboration
  - No Google Forms, no data retention—only Git and Waku logs

**📡 Outreach & Engagement:**

- Direct DMs to governance hackers, lorecrafters, and infra maintainers on:
  - Farcaster, Matrix, Twitter/X, Lens
- AMA hosted via Matrix and public stream (RPG kickoff, dev Q&A)
- Loom-style walk-through of toolkit and Cell setup demo

**📈 Metrics:**
- 10+ Cells onboarded in Week 1
- 5 Cells fork and modify toolkit with commits or PRs
- 3 external contributors added to toolkit documentation team

---

### Phase 2: Dogfooding the Exit Stack (Weeks 3–6)

**🎯 Objective:**  
Build public legitimacy and internal coordination capacity by using Logos tools in real Cell coordination and community lore development.

**🔧 Implementation:**

- **Waku Messaging Rollout:**
  - 10+ Cells set up secure Waku channels for daily coordination
  - RPG channels hosted over Waku for lore immersion + ops simulation
  - Matrix fallback rooms with minimal metadata exposure

- **Nomos Pilots:**
  - At least 5 Cells run internal votes using Nomos
  - Simulated funding, lore-based proposals, and governance experiments
  - Reflections published pseudonymously via Codex or GitHub Pages

- **Codex Archiving:**
  - RPG logs, lore zines, governance outcomes published to Codex
  - 20+ lore entries mapped to RPG decisions
  - Option to mint commemorative pages (Proof of Participation)

- **Simulation Season:**
  - Operator RPG Season One
    - Participants take on rotating lore/infra roles
    - XP earned through lore posts, coordination, and contribution
    - Nomos voting shapes next episode and faction dynamics

**📈 Metrics:**
- 15+ contributors submit lore, governance ideas, or tool feedback
- 100+ RPG decisions made and logged publicly
- 200+ Codex reads or forks of lore content

---

### Phase 3: Convergence & Invitation (Weeks 7–10)

**🎯 Objective:**  
Celebrate the Cell outcomes, remix the best ideas, and open the gates to the broader public—without tracking them.

**📘 Deliverables:**

- **The Exit Atlas (Lore Zine):**
  - Curated anthology of:
    - RPG moments and simulation decisions
    - Cell strategy write-ups and tooling breakdowns
    - “What We Learned From Exit” section, by Cells
  - Available as:
    - Printable zine
    - Codex publication
    - GitHub-hosted Markdown site
    - Optional NFT mint (opt-in, no KYC)

- **Public Showcase Event:**

  - Live demos of Cell coordination tools, lore performance, and Waku sessions
  - Publish highlights reel, lore drops, and tool adoption stats

- **Exit Funnel Activation:**
  - Remixable onboarding frames and RPG invites
  - Farcaster lore contests and GitHub onboarding quests
  - Calls for next cohort of Cells: “Fork the Future”

**📈 Metrics:**
- 25+ Cells publicly documented or archived in Codex
- 10 lore zines published from independent Cells
- 3–5 new tool modules contributed back to Exit Stack

## 🤝 Contributor Funnel (Invisible, but Real)

- No Discord bots, no pixel trackers.
- Onboarding happens through Waku, lore invites, GitHub, and word of mouth.
- Identity is optional and reputation is earned through action.

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🧙 Lorekeepers | Contribute story arcs, zines, and RPG flavor |
| 🛠️ Infra Guides | Help new Cells deploy Waku, Codex, Nomos |
| 🕸️ Bridgebuilders | Recruit and support new contributors via social channels |
| 🎲 RPG Hosts | Run narrative + governance sessions across timezones |

- GitHub issues become task boards (via Labels + Projects)
- Contributions feed directly into Nomos simulations (e.g., contributor consensus models)

---

## 🔐 Privacy Is the Premise

This campaign is a funnel with no surveillance.

- **No analytics**
- **No wallet-gated pages**
- **No tracking pixels**
- **No Discord scraping**

We grow by consent, not coercion.
