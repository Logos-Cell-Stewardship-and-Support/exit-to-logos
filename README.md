## ‚úçÔ∏è About Me

I'm **Ben West**, a campaigner, strategist, community organizer, and movement builder with over 25 years of experience across activism, operations, media relations, and policy/ political work. I've helped grow decentralized projects, coordinate large distributed teams, and design tools that support self-determined communities.

I'm excited about the Campaign Director role because Logos embodies the principles I‚Äôve worked toward for decades: consent-based coordination, resilient infrastructure, and cultural systems that empower rather than extract. This plan reflects how I would approach the work‚Äîclear-eyed, collaborative, and focused on building something enduring across borders and protocols.
